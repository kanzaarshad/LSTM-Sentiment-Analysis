Project Description
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on sentiment analysis of movie reviews using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The goal of this project is to classify movie reviews into positive or negative categories, demonstrating the application of LSTM networks in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Scripts to prepare the IMDB movie reviews dataset for training.
Model Training: Python implementation of an LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras.
Evaluation: Scripts to evaluate the model's performance on test data.
Experimentation: Jupyter notebooks for additional experiments and tuning.
